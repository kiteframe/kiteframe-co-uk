This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Generating UUIDs for Guides

By default, Commento uses the browser URL as the identifier for a page's comments. This creates work when the page's URL
changes for some reason (perhaps due to an SEO optimisation), since you then have to provide the #commento div
a `data-page-id`
attribute. To mitigate this, we provide each guide with a `commentoId` attribute, giving it a consistent ID reference
regardless of URL changes. To generate an appropriate UUID version 4 string,
visit [https://www.uuidgenerator.net/](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
